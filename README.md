<h2>ðŸ“„ Introduction</h2>

There are over 200 different definitions of terrorism. Violence is the hallmark of terrorism. A qualifying terrorist incident is commonly associated with a political motive. Understanding the attributes involved in terror attacks is a profoundly complex task. Psychologists would agree that terrorists are not highly likely to volunteer as experiment test subjects to be psychoanalyzed. Examining their activities from afar can be quite misleading as assumptions have to be made. The psychology behind terrorism due to all these complexities proves to be challenging to say the least. Understanding the patterns and behaviors behind the attacks are important to unlocking the prediction power of attacks in the future and their mitigation.

The goal of this project is to use the wide range of historic data on Global Terrorism to draw comparisons and to summarize their main characteristics in order to identify patterns or meaning. From basic data visualizations to complex multivariate analysis, we have performed data analysis at every level of the dataset to draw out key insights about the terrorist activities.

<h2>ðŸ’¾ Data</h2>

The **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

<h2>ðŸ“‹ Characteristics of the GTD</h2>
<li> Contains information on over 181,691 terrorist attacks </li>
<li> Currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks in the world </li>
<li> Includes information on more than 91,000 bombings, 20,000 assassinations, and 13,000 kidnappings and hostage events since 1970 </li>
<li> Includes information on at least 45 variables for each case, with more recent incidents including information on more than 120 variables </li>
<li> More than 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources were reviewed to collect incident data from 1998 to 2017 alone </li>

<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Objective</h2>

<li>to draw a clear understanding of the data to see if we can locate useful insights about where and when terror attacks occur worldwide</li>
<li>to create an opinion on the relatively risky and secure regions based on past experience, by in-depth analysis of the terrorist attacks worldwide.</li>
<li>to study and analyze the different terrorism acts that have taken place in various parts of the world, at different times.</li>
<li>to get acquaint of different types of terrorism acts</li>
<li>to analyze categories of terrorism acts</li>
<li>to study distribution of terrorism acts</li>
<li>to draw statistical conclusions</li>
