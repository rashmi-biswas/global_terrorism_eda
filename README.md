# Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Terrorism 

There are over 200 different definitions of terrorism. Violence is the hallmark of terrorism. A qualifying terrorist incident is commonly associated with a political motive. Understanding the attributes involved in terror attacks is a profoundly complex task. Psychologists would agree that terrorists are not highly likely to volunteer as experiment test subjects to be psychoanalyzed. Examining their activities from afar can be quite misleading as assumptions have to be made. The psychology behind terrorism due to all these complexities proves to be challenging to say the least. Understanding the patterns and behaviors behind the attacks are important to unlocking the prediction power of attacks in the future and their mitigation.

The goal of this project is to use the wide range of historic data on Global Terrorism to draw comparisons and to summarize their main characteristics in order to identify patterns or meaning. From basic data visualizations to complex multivariate analysis, we have performed data analysis at every level of the dataset to draw out key insights about the terrorist activities.
